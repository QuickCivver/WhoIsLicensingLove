This project was meant to be a Twilio app that allowed people to dial a single number in order to be routed to clerk of court offices that hadn't started issuing marriage licenses to same sex couples.

The idea was there'd be a list of numbers, a basic phone menu with recorded instructions for how to conduct the call, an option to hear tips from prev callers (with an option to flag a tip as unhelpful/offensive), and an option to leave a tip for future callers after each call.
